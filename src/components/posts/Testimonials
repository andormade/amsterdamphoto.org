			I know that choosing a photographer is quite a big decision. 
      Trusting a stranger with capturing important moments of your life is not easy. I wanted to help you a little bit so I sent out a questionnaire for almost everyone I worked with. 
     Because all what matters in the end is their overall expression about the session and their satisfaction with the final photos.

    "The way Annie works is authentic and simple yet so effective. The whole day was a vibe. When I first saw my photos I was GOBSMACKED!! I enjoyed every minute of the shoot and would do it again 10x over. Thank you Annie for a beautiful experience ❤️"</p>

    "Before we had our photoshoot, my biggest fear was to pose in front of the camera, but the atmosphere was great and she helped me to be more confident. The photos were even better than I expected. 
    The shoot was very fun, I really enjoyed it. I recommend everybody to give her a chance and get some nice photos ;)"</p>

    "My biggest fear was that I don't know how to pose. Annie was really creative with the locations and she was giving a lot of instructions."</p>

I spoke to her about some of the pictures they were not particularly my favourite. She completely understand and rectified the issue."</p>

    <p> I know exactly how stressful can it be to pose in front of the camera, to worry about oily skin, pimples or looking weird. As a former bride, I have been there. :) A pre-consultation is always included in your session fee, so if you have any more questions, worries or you feel like you'd like to get to know me a little better, all you need to do is to send me an email to mail@anniekostolany.com. I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
