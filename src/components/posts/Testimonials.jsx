			I know that choosing a photographer is quite a big decision.
			Trusting a stranger with capturing important moments of your life is
			not easy. I wanted to help you a little bit so I sent out a
			questionnaire for a bunch of people I worked with. Feedback is
			really important for me, I care a lot about how my clients feel
			before, during and after my sessions.

			whole day was a vibe. When I first saw my photos I was GOBSMACKED!!
			I enjoyed every minute of the shoot and would do it again 10x over.
			Thank you Annie for a beautiful experience ❤️"

			"Before we had our photoshoot, my biggest fear was to pose in front
			of the camera, but the atmosphere was great and she helped me to be
			more confident. The photos were even better than I expected. The
			shoot was very fun, I really enjoyed it. I recommend everybody to
			give her a chance and get some nice photos ;)"

			"10/10 experience. Annie maintained great communication and although
			the shoot was organised in short notice, Annie did her very best to
			ensure we created magic and that we did! I spoke to her about some
			of the pictures they were not particularly my favourite. She
			completely understand and rectified the issue."

			I know exactly how stressful can it be to pose in front of the
			camera, to worry about oily skin, pimples or looking weird. As a
			former bride, I have been there. :) A pre-consultation is always
			included in your session fee, so if you have any more questions,
			worries or you feel like you'd like to get to know me a little
			better, all you need to do is to send me an email to
			mail@anniekostolany.com. I will try to get back to you as soon as
			possible.
